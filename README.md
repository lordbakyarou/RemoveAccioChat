# Element Remover Chrome Extension üòé

## Description üöÄ

Element Remover is a Chrome extension that allows you to remove specific elements from the Accio Job website (https://course.acciojob.com/). This extension enhances your browsing experience by removing a particular chat element that you find distracting. üôå

## Installation üì¶

To install the Element Remover Chrome extension, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository from GitHub: [https://github.com/lordbakyarou/RemoveAccioChat/](https://github.com/lordbakyarou/RemoveAccioChat/)

2. Open Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/` in the address bar.

3. Toggle the "Developer mode" switch in the top right corner. üõ†Ô∏è

4. Click on the "Load unpacked" button and select the directory where you cloned or downloaded the repository. This will load the extension into Chrome. üöÄ

## How it Works üîç

The Element Remover extension uses a content script that runs on the Accio Job website. The content script looks for a specific element with the CSS selector "#crisp-chatbox > div > a > span.cc-imbb.cc-qfnu" and removes it after 5 seconds of page load.
