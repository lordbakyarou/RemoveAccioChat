# Element Remover Chrome Extension

## Description

Element Remover is a Chrome extension that allows you to remove specific elements from the Accio Job website (https://course.acciojob.com/). This extension enhances your browsing experience by removing a particular chat element that you find distracting.

## Installation

To install the Element Remover Chrome extension, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository from GitHub: [https://github.com/lordbakyarou/RemoveAccioChat/](https://github.com/lordbakyarou/RemoveAccioChat/)

2. Open Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/` in the address bar.

3. Toggle the "Developer mode" switch in the top right corner.

4. Click on the "Load unpacked" button and select the directory where you cloned or downloaded the repository. This will load the extension into Chrome.

## How it Works

The Element Remover extension uses a content script that runs on the Accio Job website. The content script looks for a specific element with the CSS selector "#crisp-chatbox > div > a > span.cc-imbb.cc-qfnu" and removes it after 5 seconds of page load.
